The hops on the east side of the back deck are Cascade variety.  They don't require much/any maintenence.  They are suitable for use in beer (I have used them many times in my own homebrews, they are great). 

They can be cut down in the fall, or in the spring.  Either way, they will sprout new shoots in the spring and grow voraciously all summer.  

When trimming or pruning, it's best to wear long sleeves, as the vines and leaves are very scratchy.
